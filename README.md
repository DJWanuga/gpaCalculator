Calculate the GPA of Students in College

Mission statement:  

Empower todayâ€™s students. The ultimate goal of this effort is to provide tools to help college students evaluate their current standing with regard to their academic career. In order to accomplish this by developing a GPA calculator that will allow students to view a simple snapshot of their academic progress. This calculator will allow an option for a weighted or unweighted GPA and factor in credit hours. Students will be able to use the tool to see their overall GPA or a narrower semester view. Students will also be able to see the minimum grade required for a class to maintain a chosen GPA as well as use estimated grades to calculate a predicted GPA. With this tool, students will be able to more easily evaluate their current academic status and plan for their future coursework.
